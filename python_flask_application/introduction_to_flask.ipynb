    "<h1>Introduction to Flask</h1>\n",
    "Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that allows developers to build web applications easily and quickly. It's classified as a \"micro-framework\" because it does not come with many built-in features that are found in more extensive frameworks like Django. Instead, Flask is designed to be simple and modular, allowing developers to choose which libraries or components they want to integrate based on the application's needs.<br>\n",
    "<h2>Key Features of Flask:</h2>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "  <li><strong>Minimalistic and Flexible:</strong> Flask provides the core essentials for building a web application, but it allows developers the flexibility to choose their tools and libraries for database access, form handling, authentication, etc.</li>\n",
    " <li><strong>Built-in Development Server:</strong> Flask includes a built-in web server for testing and development, making it easy to develop and test applications locally.</li>\n",
    " <li><strong>Jinja2 Templating Engine:</strong> Flask uses the Jinja2 template engine, which enables developers to create dynamic HTML pages by embedding Python code into the HTML.</li>\n",
    " <li><strong>WSGI Compliant:</strong> Flask is based on the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard, which defines how web servers interact with web applications in Python. This makes Flask compatible with any WSGI-compliant web server.</li>\n",
    " <li><strong>URL Routing:</strong> Flask provides URL routing capabilities, allowing you to define routes that map URLs to Python functions. This enables you to handle different requests and serve the appropriate content.</li>\n",
    " <li><strong>Extensible with Plugins:</strong> While Flask is lightweight, it's highly extensible. You can integrate various Flask extensions for features like database access, form validation, user authentication, etc.</li>\n",
    " <li><strong>RESTful Support:</strong> Flask makes it easy to build APIs and RESTful services because of its simple routing and request-handling capabilities.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
