    "        <p>This tutorial demonstrates how to interact with a MySQL database using Python with a focus on student registration. We'll cover all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete), SQL queries, and how to use Python’s cursor object for efficient database interaction.</p>\n",

    "    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n",

    "    age INT,\n",
    "    registration_date DATE\n",

    "        <h3>What?</h3>\n",
    "        <p>A <code>Cursor</code> object in Python is used to execute SQL queries and fetch results from the database.</p>\n",
    "        <h3>Why?</h3>\n",
    "        <p>The cursor is essential for handling database operations, such as executing queries and retrieving results. It serves as a bridge between the Python program and the database.</p>\n",
    "        <h3>How it Works</h3>\n",
    "        <p>We create a cursor using the <code>connection.cursor()</code> method and execute queries using the cursor object. Once queries are executed, the cursor is used to fetch results, and it is closed after the operations are done. Here's an example:</p>\n",
    "        <pre><code>cursor = connection.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Executing a query\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM students\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Fetching results\n",
    "students = cursor.fetchall()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Closing the cursor\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "        <h2>4. Executing Multiple Queries in a Single Connection</h2>\n",
    "        <p>In practice, you may need to execute multiple queries in a single connection. Here’s how to handle it:</p>\n",
    "        <pre><code>import mysql.connector\n",
    "\n",
    "connection = mysql.connector.connect(\n",
    "    host=\"localhost\",\n",
    "    user=\"your_username\",\n",
    "    password=\"your_password\",\n",
    "    database=\"your_database\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "cursor = connection.cursor()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Multiple queries\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"INSERT INTO students (name, email, age, registration_date) VALUES ('Jane Doe', 'jane@example.com', 22, CURDATE())\")\n",
    "cursor.execute(\"UPDATE students SET age = age + 1 WHERE name = 'Jane Doe'\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Commit the transactions\n",
    "connection.commit()\n",
    "\n",
    "cursor.close()\n",
    "connection.close()\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "        <h2>Conclusion</h2>\n",
    "        <p>Using Python and MySQL together allows you to perform various database operations efficiently. By mastering CRUD operations, SQL queries, and the use of cursor objects, you can manage any relational database easily within Python applications.</p>\n",
